## Jedi Trainer Awakens ##

jeditrainer.herokuapp.com

Our senior project is to resurrect the "Jedi Trainer" virtual reality experience. We want to build a web site to correspond with this project. It would serve multiple purposes for the Jedi Trainer. First, it would display a leaderboard of high scores from students who played the game. This leaderboard will be stored in a database, hopefully hosted on an Abstraction server. The user will be able to sort high scores in different ways, such as by difficulty, most recent, and the top all time scores. The user could also be able to search for a specific user name. Our hope is for this database to be accessed and updated from the game, and viewable on the website. Second, the website should also provide more information and FAQs about the project as well as screenshots, videos, and other media. We think it would be fascinating to livestream the Jedi Trainer, similar to a Twitch stream. A stretch goal would be to have some way for a user to control certain aspects of the droid, such as controlling shot rate, simple droid movement, and color changes.
